      Overview of Syrian Refugee Crisis
    </h1>
    <br>
    <h2>
      Introduction and Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      The refugee situation around the world, according to UNHCR, is affecting about one percent of humanity – 1 in every 97 people – and the number is growing by the year.  <br>
      Over the past decade, over 100 million people have been displaced from their countries of origin and the majority of them were not able to return home and were forcefully settled somewhere else.  <br>
      After much debate and consideration, our team has decided to dedicate our final project to presenting the history, the current situation as well as the impact of this ongoing event, which is the largest refugee and displacement crisis of our time that is still affecting about 17.6 million Syrians and numerous countries involved. <br>
      We believe that this project allows for a good educational and informational opportunity for us to present some critical data, using the various carefully crafted visualizations, to tell our audience a story about these people who were/are forced to leave their home due to endless violence and collapsed infrastructure spiraled off the Syrian Civil War, a war that has destroyed too many lives and families.
